Work:


This is an exploration into Google OAuth 2.0 and APIs. Visually, the final product is not especially flashy, however a lot of behind the scenes work was put into the exploration. Hopefully, this ground level work becomes useful in the final project.

Login to your Google account and give the proper permissions. Allow the site to find your location. It will be displayed with a blue circle.

Press [Get Events]: The site will display your 10 upcoming events from Google Calendar. 
If you add an event, a marker will be added in the corresponding location.

Add an event to your calendar. Fill out all fields, and select a location using the autocomplete bar above the map. the map will switch to the location that you have entered. Click [Add Event] If all fields are complete, the event will be added to your Google Calendar.
